The design of new datacenter networks is motivated by an array of applications ranging from communication intensive climatology, complex material simulations and molecular dynamics to such Internet applications as Web search, language translation, collaborative Internet applications, streaming video and voice-over-IP. For both Supercomputing and Cloud Computing the network enables distributed applications to communicate and interoperate in an orchestrated and efficient way.This book describes the design and engineering tradeoffs of datacenter networks. It describes interconnection networks from topology and network architecture to routing algorithms, and presents opportunities for taking advantage of the emerging technology trends that are influencing router microarchitecture. With the emergence of \"many-core\" processor chips, it is evident that we will also need \"many-port\" routing chips to provide a bandwidth-rich network to avoid the performance limiting effects of Amdahl's Law. We provide an overview of conventional topologies and their routing algorithms and show how technology, signaling rates and cost-effective optics are motivating new network topologies that scale up to millions of hosts. The book also provides detailed case studies of two high performance parallel computer systems and their networks.Table of Contents: Introduction / Background / Topology Basics / High-Radix Topologies / Routing / Scalable Switch Microarchitecture / System Packaging / Case Studies / Closing Remarks" , "name" : "high Performance datacenter networks.pdf" , "subtitle" : "Architectures, Algorithms, and Opportunities" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.50 cm\",\"width\":\"19.05 cm\",\"thickness\":\"0.64 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1608454029" , "categories" : "[\"Computer network architectures\",\"Computer networks\",\"Parallel computers\",\"Computers \\/ Systems Architecture \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Data Processing\",\"Computers \\/ Networking \\/ General\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781608454020" , "publishedDate" : "2010-11-30" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "7097eb1a-2091-4ebc-b230-fe61f82538c0" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/high Performance datacenter networks.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=1_TUzIaKkdsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

In this volume, we hope to remedy problems by (1) presenting a theoretical foundation of data-mining, and (2) providing important new directions for data-mining research.

The kernel technique takes the linear classifier‚Äîa limited, but well-established and comprehensively studied model‚Äîand extends its applicability to a wide range of nonlinear pattern-recognition tasks such as natural language processing, machine vision, and biological sequence analysis. This book provides the first comprehensive overview of both the theory and algorithms of kernel classifiers, including the most recent developments. It begins by describing the major algorithmic advances: kernel perceptron learning, kernel Fisher discriminants, support vector machines, relevance vector machines, Gaussian processes, and Bayes point machines. Then follows a detailed introduction to learning theory, including VC and PAC-Bayesian theory, data-dependent structural risk minimization, and compression bounds. Throughout, the book emphasizes the interaction between theory and algorithms: how learning algorithms work and why.

With the help of Unmasking the Face, you will be able to improve your recognition of the facial clues to emotion, increase your ability to detect \"facial deceit,\" and develop a keener awareness of the way your own face reflects your emotions. Using scores of photographs of faces that reflect the emotions of surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness, the authors of Unmasking the Face explain how to identify correctly these basic emotions and how to tell when people try to mask, simulate, or neutralize them. And, to help you better understand our own emotions and those of others, this book describes not only what these emotions look like when expressed on the face, but also what they feel like when you experience them. In addition, Unmasking the Face features several practical exercises that will help actors, teachers, salesmen, counselors, nurses, and physicians -- and everyone else who deals with people -- to become adept, perceptive readers of the facial expressions of emotion.

Tolkien's imaginative writing; he worked on the book throughout his life but never brought it to a final form. Long preceding in its origins The Lord of the Rings, it is the story of the First Age of Tolkien's world, the ancient drama to which characters in The Lord of the RIngs look back and in which some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part. </p> <p> The title Silmarillion is shortened from Quenta Silmarillion, \"The History of the Silmarils,\" the three great jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves, in which he imprisoned the light of the Two Trees that illumined Valinor, the land of the gods. When Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, destroyed the Trees, that light lived on only in the Silmarils; Morgoth seized them and set them in his crown, guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. The Silmarillion is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his people against the gods, their exile in Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all the heroisim of Elves and Men, against the great Enemy. </p> <p> The book includes several other, shorter works beside The Silmarillion proper. Preceding it are \"Ainulindale,\" the myth of Creation, and \"Valaquenta,\" in which the nature and powers of each of the gods is set forth. After The Silmarillion is \"Akallabeth,\" the story of the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age; completing the volume is \"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age,\" in which the events of The Lord of the Rings are treated in the manner of The Silmarillion. </p> <p> This new edition of The Silmarillion contains the revised and corrected \"second edition\" text and, by way of introduction, a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien in 1951, which provides a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages. It also contains almost fifty full-color illustrations by the artist Ted Nasmith, many of which appear for the first time. </p>" , "ratingsCount" : "1611" , "name" : "The Silmarillion.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0061927643" , "categories" : "[\"Middle Earth (Imaginary place)\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ General\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ Epic\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9780061927645" , "publishedDate" : "2009-05-05" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "23a341d2-a6f9-4805-8eab-1e6f1cdfbf3c" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/The Silmarillion.pdf"}

Insights into Game Theory addresses this problem by providing students with an understanding of the key concepts and ideas of game theory without using formal mathematical notation. The authors use four very different topics (college admission, social justice and majority voting, coalitions and co-operative games, and a bankruptcy problem from the Talmud) to investigate four areas of game theory.

You'll learn how all of the components of Rails fit together and how you can leverage them to create sophisticated web applications with less code and more joy. This book is particularly well suited to those with little or no experience with web application development, or who have some experience but are new to Rails. Beginning Rails assumes basic familiarity with web terms and technologies, but doesn't require you to be an expert. Topics include: A gentle introduction to the Ruby programming language Installing Ruby and Rails on a Mac, Linux, or Windows system The philosophy behind Rails and why it matters The Model-View-Controller architecture The basics of relational databases and SQL Setting up a MySQL database and creating a schema with migrations Experimenting with your live application in the Rails console Creating rich relationships between your models Using controllers and templates properly Leveraging helpers to keep your templates clean and logic free Adding Ajax and visual effects to enrich your user interfaces JavaScript with Prototype and script.aculo.us How to send and receive mail from your application Using and creating your own plug-ins Ensuring your code against Murphy's Law through writing tests Using Capistrano to deploy your application Rather than delving into the arcane details of Rails, the focus is on the aspects of the framework that will become your pick, shovel, and axe. Part history lesson, part introduction to object-oriented programming, and part dissertation on open source software, Beginning Rails doesn't just explain how to do something in Rails, it explains why.

Because of its central role, great attention has been paid to the research and development of ranking technologies. In addition, ranking is also pivotal for many other information retrieval applications, such as collaborative filtering, definition ranking, question answering, multimedia retrieval, text summarization, and online advertisement. Leveraging machine learning technologies in the ranking process has led to innovative and more effective ranking models, and eventually to a completely new research area called 'learning to rank'.Liu first gives a comprehensive review of the major approaches to learning to rank. For each approach he presents the basic framework, with example algorithms, and he discusses its advantages and disadvantages. He continues with some recent advances in learning to rank that cannot be simply categorized into the three major approaches ' these include relational ranking, query-dependent ranking, transfer ranking, and semisupervised ranking. His presentation is completed by several examples that apply these technologies to solve real information retrieval problems, and by theoretical discussions on guarantees for ranking performance.This book is written for researchers and graduate students in both information retrieval and machine learning. They will find here the only comprehensive description of the state of the art in a field that has driven the recent advances in search engine development." , "name" : "Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval.pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.50 cm\",\"width\":\"15.50 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.91 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "3642142664" , "categories" : "[\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Science\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ System Administration \\/ Storage & Retrieval\",\"Computers \\/ Internet \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Web \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Mathematical & Statistical Software\",\"Computers \\/ Artificial Intelligence\",\"Computers \\/ Data Processing \\/ Storage & Retrieval\",\"Computers \\/ Internet \\/ World Wide Web\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9783642142666" , "publishedDate" : "2011-05-29" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "727c6d3e-ab4f-4c27-af90-f06719d8d3e5" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks7.books.google.co.in/books?id=XlMBNwE0xDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks7.books.google.co.in/books?id=XlMBNwE0xDMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

The actor model of concurrency allows you to express real-world concurrency in a natural way using concurrent processes that communicate via asynchronous messages.Scala is a programming language for the Java virtual machine, providing excellent support for both object-oriented and functional programming. By including a powerful actor framework in its standard library, Scala offers a compelling approach to tackle concurrent programming. Scala's actors let you apply the actor concurrency model to the JVM, enabling real-world solutions that are efficient, scalable, and robust.Published by Artima, this is the first book on Scala's actors, co-authored by the creator and lead maintainer, Philipp Haller, and Frank Sommers. Starting with the fundamentals of the actor concurrency model, this book offers a comprehensive tutorial on practical programming with actors in Scala.

Algorithms in a Nutshell describes a large number of existing algorithms for solving a variety of problems, and helps you select and implement the right algorithm for your needs -- with just enough math to let you understand and analyze algorithm performance. With its focus on application, rather than theory, this book provides efficient code solutions in several programming languages that you can easily adapt to a specific project. Each major algorithm is presented in the style of a design pattern that includes information to help you understand why and when the algorithm is appropriate. With this book, you will: Solve a particular coding problem or improve on the performance of an existing solution Quickly locate algorithms that relate to the problems you want to solve, and determine why a particular algorithm is the right one to use Get algorithmic solutions in C, C++, Java, and Ruby with implementation tips Learn the expected performance of an algorithm, and the conditions it needs to perform at its best Discover the impact that similar design decisions have on different algorithms Learn advanced data structures to improve the efficiency of algorithms With Algorithms in a Nutshell, you'll learn how to improve the performance of key algorithms essential for the success of your software applications." , "name" : "O'Reilly  Algorithms in a Nutshell.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "059651624X" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.00 cm\",\"width\":\"14.99 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.29 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9780596516246" , "contentVersion" : "0.1.0.0.preview.3" , "pageCount" : "366" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Programming / Algorithms" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "10" , "categories" : "[\"Computer algorithms\",\"Electronic books\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ C\",\"Computers \\/ Software Development & Engineering \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ JavaScript\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ Java\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ Algorithms\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/O'Reilly  Algorithms in a Nutshell.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "2008-10-14" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "c4d59886-b215-4225-9669-4620db2116df" , "small" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=qhaOxkQANEgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Combining elements of Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, the newly introduced hybrid random fields are an interesting approach to get the best of both these worlds, with an added promise of modularity and scalability. The authors have written an enjoyable book---rigorous in the treatment of the mathematical background, but also enlivened by interesting and original historical and philosophical perspectives.-- Manfred Jaeger, Aalborg UniversitetThe book not only marks an effective direction of investigation with significant experimental advances, but it is also---and perhaps primarily---a guide for the reader through an original trip in the space of probabilistic modeling. While digesting the book, one is enriched with a very open view of the field, with full of stimulating connections. [...] Everyone specifically interested in Bayesian networks and Markov random fields should not miss it.-- Marco Gori, Universit degli Studi di SienaGraphical models are sometimes regarded---incorrectly---as an impractical approach to machine learning, assuming that they only work well for low-dimensional applications and discrete-valued domains. While guiding the reader through the major achievements of this research area in a technically detailed yet accessible way, the book is concerned with the presentation and thorough (mathematical and experimental) investigation of a novel paradigm for probabilistic graphical modeling, the hybrid random field. This model subsumes and extends both Bayesian networks and Markov random fields.

It is necessary to design and to provide for these kinds of applications as well as for those resources necessary for functionality. Multi-Objective Optimization in Computer Networks Using Metaheuristics provides a solution to the multi-objective problem in routing computer networks. It analyzes layer 3 (IP), layer 2 (MPLS), and layer 1 (GMPLS and wireless functions). In particular, it assesses basic optimization concepts, as well as several techniques and algorithms for the search of minimals; examines the basic multi-objective optimization concepts and the way to solve them through traditional techniques and through several metaheuristics; and demonstrates how to analytically model the computer networks presented within the text. The book then focuses on the multi-objective models in computer networks, optical networks, and wireless networks and the applied way they can be solved.

Richard Stevens and Addison-Wesley published a networking classic: TCP/IP Illustrated. The model for that book was a brilliant, unfettered approach to networking concepts that has proven itself over time to be popular with readers of beginning to intermediate networking knowledge. The Illustrated Network takes this time-honored approach and modernizes it by creating not only a much larger and more complicated network, but also by incorporating all the networking advancements that have taken place since the mid-1990s, which are many. This book takes the popular Stevens approach and modernizes it, employing 2008 equipment, operating systems, and router vendors. It presents an ?illustrated? explanation of how TCP/IP works with consistent examples from a real, working network configuration that includes servers, routers, and workstations. Diagnostic traces allow the reader to follow the discussion with unprecedented clarity and precision. True to the title of the book, there are 330+ diagrams and screen shots, as well as topology diagrams and a unique repeating chapter opening diagram. Illustrations are also used as end-of-chapter questions. A complete and modern network was assembled to write this book, with all the material coming from real objects connected and running on the network, not assumptions. Presents a real world networking scenario the way the reader sees them in a device-agnostic world. Doesn't preach one platform or the other.

This was a unique opportunity for highlighting the current interest in this most interdisciplinary subject. The leading space agencies: the European Space Agency (ESA) as well as NASA, the American Space Agency, have planned missions that will elucidate some of the still unknown questions underlying research in the origin of life. New results are surpassing our ability to keep well informed: the reviews that were presented at the Trieste meeting will bring the readers of this well-documented and timely book up to date in this fast-moving area. An important component of the conference was the review of the Cassini-Huygens mission due to arrive in the Saturn system just one year after the conference convened in Trieste. There was particular interest in the status of the experiments that will take place inside the atmosphere of Titan, the large satellite, which is a testing ground for the theories and experiments in the field of chemical evolution.

The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting.

This volume is subtitled Machine Learning, and there is a companion volume subtitled Cognitive Models of Complex Learning. Funding was provided by a five-year Accelerated Research Initiative (ARI), and made possible significant advances in the scientific understanding of how machines and humans can acquire new knowledge so as to exhibit improved problem-solving behavior. Significant progress in machine learning is reported along a variety of fronts. Chapters in Machine Learning include work in analogical reasoning; induction and discovery; learning and planning; learning by competition, using genetic algorithms; and theoretical limitations. Knowledge acquisition as pursued under the ARI was a coordinated research thrust into both machine learning and human learning. Chapters in Cognitive Modles of Complex Learning, also published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, include summaries of work by cognitive scientists who do computational modeling of human learning. In fact, an accomplishment of research previously sponsored by ONR's Cognitive Science Program was insight into the knowledge and skills that distinguish human novices from human experts in various domains; the Cognitive interest in the ARI was then to characterize how the transition from novice to expert actually takes place. These volumes of Foundations of Knowledge Acquisition serve as excellent reference sources by bringing together descriptions of recent and on-going research at the forefront of progress in one of the most challenging arenas of artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

The structure package, a collection of nearly 100 different classes implementing a wide variety of data structures, has been the basis of Java Structures for more than five years. Thousands of faculty, students, researchers, industrial and recreational programmers have investigated this lean and well tested approach to data structure design. In this edition, the text develops a heavily tested package that is independent of but consistent with the Collection package offered by Sun. In many cases, the variety of implementations provides the programmer choices of data structure that are not available with the Collection system. For those curricula that make use of the Collection package, the structure package can be easily integrated into existing applications. All classes are fully documented and make consistent use of pre- and post-conditioning, and include support for assertion testing. The second edition also brings a wealth of new resources, including a large number of new and original exercises and drill problems. Throughout the text, exercises appear in the running text to direct a deeper consideration of subtle issues by students. Perhaps the most innovative feature (first found in Bailey's Java Elements) is the inclusion of more than a dozen original lab exercises that focus on interesting and often classic problems of computer science.All code for the book's examples, documentation, and the STRUCTURE package is posted on the book's website at www.mhhe.com/javastructures." , "name" : " Java Structures Data Structures in Java for the Principled Programmer nd edition .pdf" , "subtitle" : "data structures in Java for the principled programmer" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"25.00 cm\",\"width\":\"19.30 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.44 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "0072399090" , "categories" : "[\"Data structures (Computer science)\",\"Java (Computer program language)\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ Java\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9780072399097" , "publishedDate" : "2003" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "d29a2e5e-844e-45ad-a565-f11881f077fb" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/ Java Structures Data Structures in Java for the Principled Programmer nd edition .pdf"}

It's a follow-up to his jQuery UI 1.6 book, which I reviewed in early 2009. With a technology that is evolving as fast as jQuery, it's important that the documentation keep up such that we may know how to best leverage the tools that we have available; Dan's latest book, jQuery UI 1.7, does just that - bringing us completely up-to-speed with all aspects of the jQuery UI library. One thing that I was thrilled to see when reading this book was that after a brief introduction to jQuery and jQuery UI, Dan dives directly into the jQuery UI CSS framework. With the 1.7 release of jQuery UI, the library has become completely standardized in the way that the markup and CSS classes are applied to the library widgets. Not only does this make it easy to uniformly skin the widgets (via tools like ThemeRoller), it provides a good structure for anyone hoping to create their own custom user interface widgets." , "ratingsCount" : "1" , "name" : "JQuery UI .pdf" , "subtitle" : "The User Interface Library for JQuery" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.50 cm\",\"width\":\"19.05 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.54 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1847199720" , "categories" : "[\"JavaScript (Computer program language)\",\"Web site development\",\"Web sites\",\"Computers \\/ Internet \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Web \\/ Page Design\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781847199720" , "publishedDate" : "2009-11-30" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "770c281d-0c1f-47ca-8405-75fc8f136306" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/JQuery UI .pdf"}

An innovative combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques has the promise of advancing the field of computer vision, which contributes to better understanding of complex real-world applications. The effective usage of machine learning technology in real-world computer vision problems requires understanding the domain of application, abstraction of a learning problem from a given computer vision task, and the selection of appropriate representations for the learnable (input) and learned (internal) entities of the system.In this book, we address all these important aspects from a new perspective: that the key element in the current computer revolution is the use of machine learning to capture the variations in visual appearance, rather than having the designer of the model accomplish this. As a bonus, models learned from large datasets are likely to be more robust and more realistic than the brittle all-design models." , "name" : "Machine Learning in Computer Vision Computational Imaging and Vision .pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"25.00 cm\",\"width\":\"16.00 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.91 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1402032749" , "categories" : "[\"Computer science\",\"Computer vision\",\"Electronic books\",\"Machine learning\",\"Multimedia systems\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Graphics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Science\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition\",\"Computers \\/ Information Technology\",\"Computers \\/ Interactive & Multimedia\",\"Computers \\/ Machine Theory\",\"Computers \\/ User Interfaces\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781402032745" , "language" : "en" , "publishedDate" : "2005-08-05" , "uuid" : "2a690c3c-5c86-401b-a30c-9575ceff64da" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Machine Learning in Computer Vision Computational Imaging and Vision .pdf" , "small" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=lemw2Rhr_PEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=lemw2Rhr_PEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

String theory has been called the \"theory of everything.\" It seeks to describe all the fundamental forces of nature. It encompasses gravity and quantum mechanics in one unifying theory. But it is unproven and fraught with controversy. After reading this book, you'll be able to draw your own conclusions about string theory.</p><p> Steve Gubser begins by explaining Einstein's famous equation <i>E = mc2</i>, quantum mechanics, and black holes. He then gives readers a crash course in string theory and the core ideas behind it. In plain English and with a minimum of mathematics, Gubser covers strings, branes, string dualities, extra dimensions, curved spacetime, quantum fluctuations, symmetry, and supersymmetry. He describes efforts to link string theory to experimental physics and uses analogies that nonscientists can understand. How does Chopin's Fantasie-Impromptu relate to quantum mechanics? What would it be like to fall into a black hole? Why is dancing a waltz similar to contemplating a string duality?

It involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. And, generalizing beyond training data, models thus learned may be used for preference prediction.This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The first half of the book is organized into parts on label ranking, instance ranking, and object ranking; while the second half is organized into parts on applications of preference learning in multiattribute domains, information retrieval, and recommender systems.The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research." , "name" : "Preference Learning.pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.50 cm\",\"width\":\"15.50 cm\",\"thickness\":\"3.18 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "3642141242" , "categories" : "[\"Machine learning\",\"Computers \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Science\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ Data Mining\",\"Computers \\/ Machine Theory\",\"Computers \\/ Artificial Intelligence\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9783642141249" , "publishedDate" : "2010-12-01" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "316f5457-2c04-4957-80bf-15a00a46e1b8" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Preference Learning.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=nc3XcH9XSgYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=nc3XcH9XSgYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Now, thanks to Hermione Granger's new translation from the ancient runes, we present this stunning edition with an introduction, notes, and illustrations by J. K. Rowling, and extensive commentary by Albus Dumbledore. Never before have Muggles been privy to these richly imaginative tales: -The Wizard and the Hopping Pot -The Fountain of Fair Fortune -The Warlock's Hairy Heart -Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump -The Tale of the Three Brothers.<br> The stories are accompanied by delightful pen-and-ink illustrations by Ms.Rowling herself, featuring a still-life frontispiece for each one. Professor Dumbledore's commentary -- apparently written some eighteen months before his death -- reveals not just his vast knowledge of Wizarding lore, but also more of his personal qualities: his sense of humor, his courage, his pride in his abilities, and his hard-won wisdom. Names familiar from the Harry Potter novels sprinkle the pages, including Aberforth Dumbledore, Lucius Malfoy and his forebears, and Sir Nicholas deMimsy-Porpington (or \"Nearly Headless Nick\"), as well as other professors at Hogwarts and the past owners of the Elder Wand. Dumbledore tells us of incidents unique to the Wizarding world, like hilariously troubled theatrical productions at Hogwarts or the dangers of having a \"hairy heart.\" But he also reveals aspects of the Wizarding world that his Muggle readers might find all too familiar, like censorship, intolerance, and questions about the deepest mysteries in life. <br> But not only are these tales the equal of fairy tales we now know and love, reading them gives new insight into the world of Harry Potter. This purchase also represents another very important form of giving: From every sale of this book, Scholastic will give its net proceeds to The Children's High Level Group, a charity cofounded in 2005 by J.

It also develops a runtime environment that can be ported to different parallel platforms and describes the formal model of action systems. Distributed Systems The next part presents a process algebra (mCRL2) that targets distributed applications, looks at how to turn prose descriptions into unambiguous specifications, extends pi-calculus to create a service-oriented mobility abstract machine, and introduces the Channel Ambient Machine for mobile applications. Embedded Systems The final section combines state-based Z with the event-based process algebra CSP in a formal methodology called Circus. It also develops a pair of process algebras (PARS) to address the problem of scheduling in real-time embedded systems and emphasizes the reuse of concurrent artifacts across different hardware platforms.

Processor clusters, local and wide area networks, and the information highway evolved a new kind of problems which can be solved with distributed algorithms.In this textbook a variety of distributed algorithms are presented independently of particular programming languages or hardware, using the graphically suggestive technique of Petri nets which is both easy to comprehend intuitively and formally rigorous. By means of temporal logic the author provides surprisingly simple yet powerful correctness proofs for the algorithms.The scope of the book ranges from distributed control and synchronization of two sites up to algorithms on any kind of networks.

Graphs can model additional information which is often not present in commonly used data representations, such as vectors. Through the use of graph distance -- a relatively new approach for determining graph similarity -- the authors show how well-known algorithms, such as k-means clustering and k-nearest neighbors classification, can be easily extended to work with graphs instead of vectors. This allows for the utilization of additional information found in graph representations, while at the same time employing well-known, proven algorithms. To demonstrate and investigate these novel techniques, the authors have selected the domain of web content mining, which involves the clustering and classification of web documents based on their textual substance. Several methods of representing web document content by graphs are introduced; an interesting feature of these representations is that they allow for a polynomial time distance computation, something which is typically an NP-complete problem when using graphs. Experimental results are reported for both clustering and classification in three web document collections using a variety of graph representations, distance measures, and algorithm parameters. In addition, this book describes several other related topics, many of which provide excellent starting points for researchers and students interested in exploring this new area of machine learning further. These topics include creating graph-based multiple classifier ensembles through random node selection and visualization of graph-based data usingmultidimensional scaling." , "name" : "Graph Theoretic Techniques for Web Content Mining Series in Machine Perception and Artificial Intelligence .pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"16.05 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.98 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "9812563393" , "categories" : "[\"Algorithms\",\"Data mining\",\"Graph theory\\/ Data processing\",\"Graph theory\",\"Multidimensional scaling\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ Data Mining\",\"Mathematics \\/ Algebra \\/ General\",\"Mathematics \\/ Graphic Methods\",\"Mathematics \\/ Combinatorics\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9789812563392" , "publishedDate" : "2005-06-01" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "ab6e17c8-d398-4907-b069-11780e3b50a2" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Graph Theoretic Techniques for Web Content Mining Series in Machine Perception and Artificial Intelligence .pdf" , "small" : "http://bks3.books.google.co.in/books?id=hNJozkPJAEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks3.books.google.co.in/books?id=hNJozkPJAEwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

As a consequence, multistrategy systems have the potential to be applicable to a wide range of practical problems. This volume is the first book in this fast growing field. It contains a selection of contributions by leading researchers specializing in this area.</p>" , "name" : "Machine Learning.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "1558602518" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"16.31 cm\",\"thickness\":\"4.60 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9781558602519" , "contentVersion" : "0.1.0.0.preview.0" , "pageCount" : "798" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Artificial Intelligence" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "5" , "subtitle" : "A Multistrategy Approach" , "categories" : "[\"Artificial intelligence\",\"Machine learning\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Machine Theory\",\"Computers \\/ Artificial Intelligence\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Machine Learning.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "1994-02-23" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "a3a2057c-e52d-4077-998d-21b3713605f2" , "small" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks9.books.google.co.in/books?id=sQJ1PMEOOY0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.<br><br><i>Probabilistic Graphical Models</i> discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques.

The book begins by exploring the roots of Ajax, covering how the evolution of the web and new technologies directly led to the development of Ajax techniques. A detailed discussion of how frames, JavaScript, cookies, XML, and XMLHttp requests (XHR) related to Ajax is included. After this introduction, the book moves on to cover the implementation of specific Ajax techniques. Request brokers such as hidden frames, dynamic iframes, and XHR are compared and contrasted, explaining when one method should be used over another. To make this discussion clearer, a brief overview of HTTP requests and responses is included.<p>Once a basic understanding of the various request types is discussed, the book moves on to provide in-depth examples of how and when to use Ajax in a web site or web application. Different data transmission formats, including plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON are discussed for their advantages and disadvantages. Also included is a discussion on web services and how they may be used to perform Ajax techniques. Next, more complex topics are covered. A chapter introducing a request management framework explores how to manage all of the requests inside of an Ajax application. Ajax debugging techniques are also discussed.<p>The last part of the book walks through the creation of two full-fledged Ajax web applications. The first, FooReader.NET, is an Ajax-powered RSS reader. The second, called AjaxMail, is an Ajax-enabled email system. Both of these applications incorporate many of the techniques discussed throughout the book.<p>Professional Ajax 2nd edition is written for Web application developers looking to enhance the usability of their web sites and web applications and intermediate JavaScript developers looking to further understand the language. Readers should have familiarity with XML, XSLT, Web Services, PHP or C#, HTML, CSS. This book is not aimed at beginners without a basic understanding of the aforementioned technologies. Also, a good understanding of JavaScript is vitally important to understanding this book. Those readers without such knowledge should instead refer to books such as Beginning JavaScript, Second Edition (Wrox, 2004, ISBN: 978-0-7645-5587-9) and Professional JavaScript for Web Developers (Wrox, 2005, ISBN: 978-0-7645-7908-0).<p>Professional Ajax 2nd edition adds nearly 200 pages of new and expanded coverage compared to the first edition.

Build your network once using cfengine, and the network build will work, without user intervention, on any hardware you prefer.Automating Linux and Unix System Administration, Second Editionis unique in its focus on how to make the system administrator's job easier and more efficient: instead of just managing the system administrator's time, the book explains the technology to automate repetitive tasks and the methodology to automate successfully. Both new and seasoned professionals will profit from industry‚Äìleading insights into the automation process. System administrators will attain a thorough grasp of cfengine, kickstart, and shell scripting for automation. After reading all chapters and following all exercises in this book, the reader will be able to set up anything from a Linux datacenter to a small office network. What you'll learn See how to make changes on many UNIX and Linux hosts at once in a reliable and repeatable manner. Learn how to automate things correctly so you only have to do it once, by leveraging the authors' experience in setting up small, medium, and large networks. Set up a Linux datacenter or a network correctly. Explore handling real‚Äìworld environments where not all hosts are configured alike via a case study of a fictional new datacenter buildout. Examine real‚Äìworld examples for core infrastructure services (DNS, mail, monitoring, log analysis, security, cfengine, imaging) to build on in your environment. Understand core system administration best practices, which are a key part of how cfengine and automations deployments are outlined in the book. Learn how to make changes reversible, repeatable, and correct the first time through interaction with product/application stakeholders (programmers, product managers, customers, etc.). Who this book is for This book is for Linux system administrators who want to learn about the software and methodology to automate repetitive tasks-regardless of network or datacenter size-in one place. System managers will also find it much easier to think about network technology and automation projects if they read this book.

Events make it possible for such parts to interact without any coupling. And the resulting parts can be developed and tested individuallywhich keeps the code clean and simple. Component-based development (CBD) is an extension of object-oriented programming. CBD does away with the language and vendor-specific limitations of OOP, makes software reuse more practical and accelerates the development process. Event-based programming is the next logical step in CBD, and makes components more reusable due to their decoupled nature. But event-based systems are easier to develop, which means they're cheaper and more reliable than traditional OOP or CBD systems. This book teaches you how to develop software based on parts that interact primarily through an event mechanism. You'll learn how to use events in many different situations, to solve recurring development problems without coupling. The book introduces Signal Wiring Diagram, a novel form of software diagram similar to the circuit diagrams used by hardware designers. The book concludes with a series of case studies, incorporating all featured concepts.

Newly updated and expanded with the author‚Äôs preferred text, this commemorative volume is a true celebration of a modern masterpiece by the one, the only, Neil Gaiman. </p> <p> A storm is coming . . . </p> <p> Locked behind bars for three years, Shadow did his time, quietly waiting for the magic day when he could return to Eagle Point, Indiana. A man no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, all he wanted was to be with Laura, the wife he deeply loved, and start a new life. </p> <p> But just days before his release, Laura and Shadow‚Äôs best friend are killed in an accident. With his life in pieces and nothing to keep him tethered, Shadow accepts a job from a beguiling stranger he meets on the way home, an enigmatic man who calls himself Mr. Wednesday. A trickster and rogue, Wednesday seems to know more about Shadow than Shadow does himself. </p> <p> Life as Wednesday‚Äôs bodyguard, driver, and errand boy is far more interesting and dangerous than Shadow ever imagined‚Äîit is a job that takes him on a dark and strange road trip and introduces him to a host of eccentric characters whose fates are mysteriously intertwined with his own. Along the way Shadow will learn that the past never dies; that everyone, including his beloved Laura, harbors secrets; and that dreams, totems, legends, and myths are more real than we know. Ultimately, he will discover that beneath the placid surface of everyday life a storm is brewing‚Äîan epic war for the very soul of America‚Äîand that he is standing squarely in its path. </p> <p> Relevant and prescient, <i>American Gods</i> has been lauded for its brilliant synthesis of ‚Äúmystery, satire, sex, horror, and poetic prose‚Äù (Michael Dirda, <i>Washington Post Book World</i>) and as a modern phantasmagoria that ‚Äúdistills the essence of America‚Äù (<i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i>).

Arising from the EU MUSCLE network, a program that drew together multidisciplinary teams with expertise in machine learning, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and image, video, text and crossmedia processing, the book first introduces the machine learning principles and techniques that are applied in multimedia data processing and analysis. The second part focuses on multimedia data processing applications, with chapters examining specific machine learning issues in domains such as image retrieval, biometrics, semantic labelling, mobile devices, and mining in text and music.This book will be suitable for practitioners, researchers and students engaged with machine learning in multimedia applications." , "name" : "Machine Learning Techniques for Multimedia Case Studies on Organization and Retrieval Cognitive Technologies .pdf" , "subtitle" : "case studies on organization and retrieval" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"15.50 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.91 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "354075170X" , "categories" : "[\"Artificial intelligence\",\"Computer science\",\"Data mining\",\"Electronic books\",\"Information storage and retrieval systems\",\"Machine learning\",\"Multimedia systems\",\"Text processing\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ Data Mining\",\"Computers \\/ System Administration \\/ Storage & Retrieval\",\"Computers \\/ Interactive & Multimedia\",\"Computers \\/ Machine Theory\",\"Computers \\/ Document Management\",\"Computers \\/ User Interfaces\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9783540751700" , "publishedDate" : "2008-02-01" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "72029a3f-b4d5-417d-9b59-33f39796ffa5" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Machine Learning Techniques for Multimedia Case Studies on Organization and Retrieval Cognitive Technologies .pdf" , "small" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=uSvYmki2yg0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=uSvYmki2yg0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning." , "name" : "Information Theory Inference and Learning Algorithms.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0521642981" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"26.00 cm\",\"width\":\"18.90 cm\",\"thickness\":\"3.40 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9780521642989" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "644" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Information Theory" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "13" , "categories" : "[\"Algorithms\",\"Inference\",\"Information theory\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition\",\"Computers \\/ Information Theory\",\"Computers \\/ Neural Networks\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Data Modeling & Design\",\"Mathematics \\/ Algebra \\/ General\",\"Philosophy \\/ Logic\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Information Theory Inference and Learning Algorithms.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "2003-10-06" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "1e279399-e763-44ed-ba2f-a9b087bd8318" , "small" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

The Fields of Electronics: Understanding Electronics Using Basic Physics offers a highly original correction to this state of affairs.<br> Most engineers learn circuit theory and field theory separately. Electromagnetic field theory is an important part of basic physics, but because it is a very mathematical subject, the connection to everyday problems is not emphasized. Circuit theory, on the other hand, is by its nature very practical. However, circuit theory cannot describe the nature of a facility, the interconnection of many pieces of hardware, or the power grid that interfaces each piece of hardware.<br> The Fields of Electronics offers a unique approach that brings the physics and the circuit theory together into a seamless whole for today's practicing engineers.

It plugs a gap in understanding Wells's contribution to exploring and advancing the possibilities of cinematic narrative and its social and ideological impacts in the modern period. Previous studies concentrate on adaptations: this book accounts for the specifically (proto)cinematic techniques and concerns of Wells's texts. It also focuses on contemporary film-making 'in dialogue' with his ideas. Alongside Hollywood's later transactions, it gives equal weight to neglected British and continental European dimensions. Chapter 1 shows how early writings (The Time Machine and short stories) feature many kinds of radically defamiliarised vision. These constitute imaginative speculations about the forms and potentials of moving image and electronic media. Chapter 2 discusses the power of voyeurism, 'absent presence' and the disjunction of sound-image reproduction implied in The Invisible Man and its topical politics, updated in notable screen versions. Chapter 3 extends this to dystopian warnings of systematic surveillance, broadcasting of celebrity personae and 'post-literate' video culture in When the Sleeper Wakes, a crucial template for urban futures on film. Chapter 4 analyses Wells's belated return to screenwriting in the 1930s. It accounts for his 'broadbrow' ambition of mediating between popular and avant-garde tendencies to promote his cause and its mixed results in Things to Come, The Man Who Could Work Miracles, etc. Chapter 5 finally surveys Wells's legacy on both small and large screens. It considers whether, as well as being raided for scenarios for spectacular effects, his subtexts still nourish an evolving tradition of alternative SF, which duly critiques the innovations and applications of its host media." , "name" : " Science Fiction H G Wells Complete Works.pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"15.60 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.54 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1846310598" , "categories" : "[\"Film and video adaptations\",\"History and criticism\",\"Science fiction films\\/ History and criticism\",\"Science fiction films\",\"Science fiction, English\\/ Film and video adaptations\",\"Science fiction, English\",\"Wells, H.

Hawking\",\"Stephen Hawking\",\"Roger Penrose\"]" , "title" : "The Nature of Space and Time" , "description" : "Einstein said that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible. But was he right? Can the quantum theory of fields and Einstein's general theory of relativity, the two most accurate and successful theories in all of physics, be united in a single quantum theory of gravity? Can quantum and cosmos ever be combined? On this issue, two of the world's most famous physicists--Stephen Hawking (A Brief History of Time) and Roger Penrose (The Emperor's New Mind and Shadows of the Mind)--disagree. Here they explain their positions in a work based on six lectures with a final debate, all originally presented at the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge.How could quantum gravity, a theory that could explain the earlier moments of the big bang and the physics of the enigmatic objects known as black holes, be constructed? Why does our patch of the universe look just as Einstein predicted, with no hint of quantum effects in sight? What strange quantum processes can cause black holes to evaporate, and what happens to all the information that they swallow? Why does time go forward, not backward?In this book, the two opponents touch on all these questions. Penrose, like Einstein, refuses to believe that quantum mechanics is a final theory. Hawking thinks otherwise, and argues that general relativity simply cannot account for how the universe began. Only a quantum theory of gravity, coupled with the no-boundary hypothesis, can ever hope to explain adequately what little we can observe about our universe. Penrose, playing the realist to Hawking's positivist, thinks that the universe is unbounded and will expand forever. The universe can be understood, he argues, in terms of the geometry of light cones, the compression and distortion of spacetime, and by the use of twistor theory. With the final debate, the reader will come to realize how much Hawking and Penrose diverge in their opinions of the ultimate quest to combine quantum mechanics and relativity, and how differently they have tried to comprehend the incomprehensible.In a new afterword, the authors outline how recent developments have caused their positions to further diverge on a number of key issues, including the spatial geometry of the universe, inflationary versus cyclic theories of the cosmos, and the black-hole information-loss paradox. Though much progress has been made, Hawking and Penrose stress that physicists still have much farther to go in their quest for a quantum theory of gravity." , "name" : "The Nature Of Space And Time.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0691145709" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"22.86 cm\",\"width\":\"15.24 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.91 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9780691145709" , "contentVersion" : "0.3.0.0.preview.3" , "pageCount" : "157" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Science / Quantum Theory" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "11" , "categories" : "[\"Astrophysics\",\"Cosmology\",\"Quantum theory\",\"Space and time\",\"Philosophy \\/ Metaphysics\",\"Science \\/ Astrophysics & Space Science\",\"Science \\/ Cosmology\",\"Science \\/ Physics\",\"Science \\/ Quantum Theory\",\"Science \\/ Relativity\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/The Nature Of Space And Time.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "2010-02-28" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "9e656fd5-58ca-4150-babe-cbee644395b9" , "small" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=6a-agBFWuyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Special constraints apply to this domain, which are not always taken into consideration by academic research, but are critical for successful security applications: large volumes: techniques must be able to handle huge amounts of data and perform 'on-line' computation; scalability: algorithms must have processing times that scale well with ever growing volumes; automation: the analysis process must be automated so that information extraction can 'run on its own'; ease of use: everyday citizens should be able to extract and assess the necessary information; and robustness: systems must be able to cope with data of poor quality (missing or erroneous data). The NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Mining Massive Data Sets for Security, held in Italy, September 2007, brought together around ninety participants to discuss these issues. This publication includes the most important contributions, but can of course not entirely reflect the lively interactions which allowed the participants to exchange their views and share their experience.

In other words, Hawking gave us a new look at our world, our universe, and ourselves. Now, available for the first time in trade paperback, Hawking presents an even more comprehensive look at our universe, its creation, and how we see ourselves within it. Imagine sitting in a comfortable room listening to Hawking discuss his latest theories and place them in historical context with science's other great achievements--it would be like hearing Christopher Columbus deliver the news about the new world. Hawking presents a series of seven lectures in which he describes, more clearly than ever, the history of the universe as we know it. He begins with the history of ideas about the universe, from Aristotle's idea that the Earth is round to Hubble's discovery two millennium later that our universe is growing. Using this history as a launching pad, Hawking takes us on a fascinating journey through the telescopic lens of modern physics to gain a new glimpse of the universe--the nature of black holes, the space-time continuum, and new information about the origin of the universe. He uses this scientific basis to come up with a \"unified theory of everything\" that the author claims will be \"the ultimate triumph of human reason.\"" , "ratingsCount" : "3" , "name" : "Theory of Everything.pdf" , "subtitle" : "The Origin and Fate of the Universe" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"22.76 cm\",\"width\":\"16.76 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.50 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1597775541" , "categories" : "[\"Cosmology\",\"Science - Philosophy\",\"Science\\/ Philosophy\",\"Science \\/ General\",\"Science \\/ Cosmology\",\"Science \\/ Physics\",\"Science \\/ Reference\",\"Science \\/ Philosophy & Social Aspects\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781597775540" , "publishedDate" : "2007-11-01" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "b653812d-f501-47d7-8e57-1dbbbb8acd9e" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Theory of Everything.pdf"}

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. \"Head First Java\" combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, \"Head First Java\" compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you." , "name" : "Head First Java nd edition.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0596009208" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"20.32 cm\",\"thickness\":\"3.78 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9780596009205" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "722" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "105" , "categories" : "[\"Electronic books\",\"Java (Computer program language)\",\"Object-oriented programming (Computer science)\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ Object Oriented\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ Java\",\"Computers \\/ Certification Guides \\/ General\"]" , "publishedDate" : "2005" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "b7b9e250-e0a6-40d4-b661-f16b3823fd94" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Head First Java nd edition.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=5VTBuvfZDyoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

They first show how game theory can teach readers to manage the interdependencies and interconnectedness among coworkers, managers, and others in a manner that supports personal career efforts. Second, they show how readers can become better players. The key to learning how to play the career game is \"career agility\"‚Äîin short, agile individuals are better game players.

Why would you use Django? Why would you use jQuery? Why would you use both together? Enter Django JavaScript Integration: AJAX and jQuery _ your comprehensive answer to all these questions and the only extensive, practical, and hands-on guide to developing any AJAX application with Django and jQuery.Gone are the days when you used to lament over the lack of official documentation on AJAX with Django. This book will teach you exactly why Django is called \"The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines\", how jQuery _ the \"write less do more\" JavaScript library _ is practically a virtual higher-level language, and why they both deserve to be integrated with AJAX.This hands-on-guide shows you how to put Django and jQuery together in the process of creating an AJAX application. In this book, they are brought together in a real-world scenario, with attention to usability, to build and develop an AJAX application.The first two chapters provide a short and necessary introduction to the world of Django, jQuery, and AJAX; and the remaining chapters are based on a case study that will make you realize the immense potential and benefits of integrating Django and jQuery with your AJAX application.By the time you are done with this book, you'll be developing your AJAX applications with Django and jQuery in less time than you can say \"integrate\".You will cover the basics of AJAX; use jQuery, the commonest JavaScript library, on the client side, and learn form validation with an eye to usability, build things with Django on the server-side, handle login and authentication via Django-based AJAX, and then dip into the rich jQuery plugin ecosystem to build in-place editing into your pages. You will add auto-complete functionality courtesy of jQuery UI, easily build forms with Django ModelForm, and then look at a client-side search implementation that can look things up without network access after initial download. You will learn to Implement a simple, expandable undo system, and offer more full-blooded account management, tinker, fix some bugs, offer a more usable way to handle password input, add local time support for people who are not in your time zone, look at usability, and finally take a look at debugging.After working through this book, you will have both an AJAX application and a deep understanding that you can use to customize, extend, and further develop it in your organization.This book has been written and tested for Django v 1.2.3 and jQuery v 1.4.4." , "name" : "Django JavaScript Integration  AJAX and jQuery .pdf" , "subtitle" : "AJAX and JQuery" , "ISBN_10" : "1849510342" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\"}" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "categories" : "[\"Ajax (Web site development technology)\",\"Django (Electronic resource)\",\"JavaScript (Computer program language)\",\"Computers \\/ Internet \\/ General\"]" , "ISBN_13" : "9781849510349" , "publishedDate" : "2010-12-25" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "627b3746-7c4c-40fe-b20f-1169c63b6972" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Django JavaScript Integration  AJAX and jQuery .pdf"}

Statistical relational learning builds on ideas from probability theory and statistics to address uncertainty while incorporating tools from logic, databases and programming languages to represent structure. In Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, leading researchers in this emerging area of machine learning describe current formalisms, models, and algorithms that enable effective and robust reasoning about richly structured systems and data. The early chapters provide tutorials for material used in later chapters, offering introductions to representation, inference and learning in graphical models, and logic. The book then describes object-oriented approaches, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models as well as logic-based formalisms including Bayesian logic programs, Markov logic, and stochastic logic programs. Later chapters discuss such topics as probabilistic models with unknown objects, relational dependency networks, reinforcement learning in relational domains, and information extraction. By presenting a variety of approaches, the book highlights commonalities and clarifies important differences among proposed approaches and, along the way, identifies important representational and algorithmic issues.

Yet, prediction algorithms can be constructed that work well for all possible sequences, in the sense that their performance is always nearly as good as the best forecasting strategy in a given reference class. The central theme is the model of prediction using expert advice, a general framework within which many related problems can be cast and discussed. Repeated game playing, adaptive data compression, sequential investment in the stock market, sequential pattern analysis, and several other problems are viewed as instances of the experts' framework and analyzed from a common nonstochastic standpoint that often reveals new and intriguing connections.

With <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks,</i> by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online. This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book. Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, <i>Seven Languages</i> hits what's essential and unique about each language. Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages.<br><br> For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features. As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them.<br><br> Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time. Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.<br><br> Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala. Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.<br><br> It's all here, all in one place. Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.</p>" , "ratingsCount" : "15" , "name" : "seven languages in seven weeks.pdf" , "subtitle" : "A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"22.86 cm\",\"width\":\"19.05 cm\",\"thickness\":\"3.81 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "193435659X" , "categories" : "[\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Software Development & Engineering \\/ General\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781934356593" , "publishedDate" : "2010-11-10" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "e9c52a73-94f2-44ee-8332-903bbc68f950" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/seven languages in seven weeks.pdf"}

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.<br><br>Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys‚Äôs claim to Westeros forever.<br><br>Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice and stone‚Äîa structure only as strong as those guarding it. There, Jon Snow, 998th Lord Commander of the Night‚Äôs Watch, will face his greatest challenge. For he has powerful foes not only within the Watch but also beyond, in the land of the creatures of ice.<br><br>From all corners, bitter conflicts reignite, intimate betrayals are perpetrated, and a grand cast of outlaws and priests, soldiers and skinchangers, nobles and slaves, will face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Some will fail, others will grow in the strength of darkness. But in a time of rising restlessness, the tides of destiny and politics will lead inevitably to the greatest dance of all.</p>" , "ratingsCount" : "2201" , "name" : " A Dance With Dragons.pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.33 cm\",\"width\":\"16.38 cm\",\"thickness\":\"5.33 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "0553801473" , "categories" : "[\"Fantasy fiction\",\"Imaginary places\",\"Outlaws\",\"Peace\",\"Seven kingdoms (Imaginary place)\",\"Seven kingoms (Imaginary place)\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ General\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ Epic\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9780553801477" , "publishedDate" : "2011-07-12" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "c7af79ab-efea-4a6f-914a-926463bfbecb" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/ A Dance With Dragons.pdf"}

The author is one of the world's top string theorists, and is also known as a clear and cogent writer. The two volumes are written at a level appropriate to graduate students in physics. This is the first major textbook on strings since the two volume work of Green, Schwartz and Witten 10 years ago (which sold extraordinarily well, reprinting within a month of publication).

The theoretical ideas are then applied to practical areas such as statistical inference, random walks, statistical mechanics and communications modelling. Topics dealt with include discrete and continuous random variables, entropy and mutual information, maximum entropy methods, the central limit theorem and the coding and transmission of information.

What is wrong with Will's mother? Are her concerns real, imagined, or both? Why and how does Will protect her? 2. What does it mean when Lyra assumes Will's daemon is 'inside'? Do the people in Will's world, our world, have daemons at all? 3. Why does Will's being a murderer enable Lyra to trust him? What characters do Serafina Pekkala and Lee Scoresby decide to trust, and is their trust warranted? In what other ways does trust play an important role in this novel? 4. How has Will learned to make himself unnoticed by others? Relate this to the witches' ability to make themselves invisible. 5. How do the Shadows that communicate with Lyra through the computer relate to dark matter and/or Dust? If Lyra can understand the Shadows as she understands the alethiometer, then is the computer also acting as a truth-giving device? What is the real origin of the Shadows' messages? 6. On page 188, Giacomo Paradisi tells Will the rules for bearing the subtle knife. Why do you think Will must 'never open without closing'? What did Paradisi mean by 'a base purpose'? Compare these formal guidelines to the instinctive rules Lyra obeys when using the alethiometer. 7. Why is it significant that the possessors of the alethiometer and the subtle knife are children? What is the difference between innocence and experience? What has happened to Mrs. Coulter's solders who have undergone intercision? 8. Lord Asriel is mentioned several times throughout the story, yet we never directly see him. He is planning a war that he cannot win without an object that he does not know exists. What does Lord Asriel symbolize in The Subtle Knife ? 9. What did the 'Cave' mean when it told Dr. Malone that she must be 'the serpent'? Where do you think she is at the end of the story? Where is Lyra? 10. In what way can a knife that divides pathways between worlds and can sever bone, rock, and steel be called 'subtle'? 11. DISCUSSION TOPICS IF YOU HAVE READ THE GOLDEN COMPASS AND THE SUBTLE KNIFE In Book One, Lyra is clearly a leader. In Book Two, she seems to have become a follower, a servant to Will's cause. Who is more powerful, Will or Lyra? Whose cause is more important? Is it the same cause? 12. Is the 'psychic death' caused by severing the same as that caused by the Specters? Compare Tony Makarios and the servants at Bolvangar (Book One) to Tullio's actions after Will takes the subtle knife and the final thoughts of Lena Feldt (Book Two). Relate these to the 'natural' deaths suffered by Lee Scoresby and John Parry. 13. Armored bears, witches, severed children and adults, cliff-ghasts, Spectres, and angels are beings with spiritual qualities different from humans. Why does the authorintroduce so many creatures with alternative soul-states? 14. By the end of The Subtle Knife, we have learned that both Will's father, John Parry/Stanislaus Grumman, and Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, are powerful men who have traveled between worlds. Yet one is called a shaman while the other is preparing to be a general. What is the relationship between these two men? Compare it to the relationship between Will and Lyra. 15. The Golden Compass takes place in a 'closed' world where Lyra finds guidance through her newly-found alethiometer. In The Subtle Knife , boundaries between worlds have been broken, Lyra loses her alethiometer, and Will becomes the reluctant bearer of the knife.

A lens to security issues in distributed systems is best provided via deeper exploration of security concerns and solutions in these technologies.¬† <p> <p> <i>Distributed Systems Security</i> provides a holistic insight into current security issues, processes, and solutions, and maps out future directions in the context of today‚Äôs distributed systems.¬† This insight is elucidated by modeling of modern day distributed systems using a four-tier logical model ‚Äìhost layer, infrastructure layer, application layer, and service layer (bottom to top). The authors provide an in-depth coverage of security threats and issues across these tiers. Additionally the authors describe the approaches required for efficient security engineering, alongside exploring how existing solutions can be leveraged or enhanced to proactively meet the dynamic needs of security for the next-generation distributed systems.

In fact, recent progress in theoretical physics, and in particular in String Theory, suggests answers to the above questions, providing us with mathematical tools able in principle to reconstruct the history of the Universe even for times before the big bang. In the emerging cosmological scenario the Universe, at the epoch of the big bang, instead of being a \"new born baby\" was actually a rather \"aged\" creature in the middle of its possibly infinitely enduring evolution.

The implementation of the PML ABC in the FDTD method is presented in detail. Propagation and reflection of waves in the discretized FDTD space are derived and discussed, with a special emphasis on the problem of evanescent waves. The optimization of the PML ABC is addressed in two typical applications of the FDTD method: first, wave-structure interaction problems, and secondly, wave guide problems.

In this thesis, we develop the first analog of these general discriminative models to the problems of Semi-Supervised Learning and Clustering, and we analyze both their algorithmic and sample complexity implications. We also provide the first generalization of the well-established theory of learning with kernel functions to case of general pairwise similarity functions and in addition provide new positive theoretical results for Active Learning Finally, this dissertation presents new applications of techniques from Machine Learning to Algorithmic Game Theory, which has been a major area of research at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics." , "ratingsCount" : "1" , "name" : "Theory and Novel Applications of Machine Learning .pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "054995757X" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9780549957577" , "language" : "en" , "publishedDate" : "2008" , "uuid" : "cde3c93f-e14a-4f28-a761-6b8c31620dcd" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Theory and Novel Applications of Machine Learning .pdf" , "small" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=t__UuNy8lLkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=t__UuNy8lLkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Unique material on the most intriguing and fascinating topics of unsolved and current problems in contemporary chaos theory is presented. The coverage includes: separatrix chaos; properties and a description of systems with non-ergodic dynamics; the distribution of Poincar√© recurrences and their role in transport theory; dynamical models of the Maxwell's Demon, the occurrence of persistent fluctuations, and a detailed discussion of their role in the problem underlying the foundation of statistical physics; the emergence of stochastic webs in phase space and their link to space tiling with periodic (crystal type) and aperiodic (quasi-crystal type) symmetries. This second edition expands on pseudochaotic dynamics with weak mixing and the new phenomenon of fractional kinetics, which is crucial to the transport properties of chaotic motion. The book is ideally suited to all those who are actively working on the problems of dynamical chaos as well as to those looking for new inspiration in this area. It introduces the physicist to the world of Hamiltonian chaos and the mathematician to actual physical problems.The material can also be used by graduate students." , "name" : "The Physics of Chaos in Hamiltonian Systems.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "1860947956" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"24.00 cm\",\"width\":\"16.46 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.31 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9781860947957" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "337" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Science / Chaotic Behavior in Systems" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "1" , "categories" : "[\"Chaotic behavior in systems\",\"Hamiltonian systems\",\"Mathematical physics\",\"Mathematics \\/ Differential Equations\",\"Science \\/ Chaotic Behavior in Systems\",\"Science \\/ Mathematical Physics\",\"Science \\/ Physics\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/The Physics of Chaos in Hamiltonian Systems.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "2007" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "75eed6ce-8e46-4b6a-b2d4-9eec0bc2322f" , "small" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=W9FKkQCac8IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

{ "averageRating" : "4.5" , "infoLink" : "http://books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&ie=ISO-8859-1&source=gbs_api" , "publisher" : "O'Reilly Media, Inc." , "authors" : "[\"Gregory Satir\",\"Doug Brown\"]" , "title" : "C++" , "description" : "C++ is an object-oriented enhancement of the C programming language and is becoming the language of choice for serious software development. C++ has crossed the Single Book Complexity Barrier. The individual features are not all that complex, but when put together in a program they interact in highly non-intuitive ways. Many books discuss each of the features separately, giving readers the illusion that they understand the language. But when they try to program, they're in for a painful surprise (even people who already know C). C++: The Core Language is for C programmers transitioning to C++. It's designed to get readers up to speed quickly by covering an essential subset of the language. The subset consists of features without which it's just not C++, and a handful of others that make it a reasonably useful language. You can actually use this subset (using any compiler) to get familiar with the basics of the language. Once you really understand that much, it's time to do some programming and learn more from other books. After reading this book, you'll be far better equipped to get something useful out of a reference manual, a graphical user interface programming book, and maybe a book on the specific libraries you'll be using. (Take a look at our companion book, Practical C++ Programming.) C++: The Core Language includes sidebars that give overviews of all the advanced features not covered, so that readers know they exist and how they fit in. It covers features common to all C++ compilers, including those on UNIX, Windows NT, Windows, DOS, and Macintosh. Comparison: C++: The Core Language vs.Practical C++ Programming O'Reilly's policy is not to publish two books on the same topic for the same audience. We'd rather spend twice the time on making one book the industry's best. So why do we have two C++ tutorials? Which one should you get? The answer is they're very different. Steve Oualline, author of the successful book Practical C Programming, came to us with the idea of doing a C++ edition. Thus was born Practical C++ Programming. It's a comprehensive tutorial to C++, starting from the ground up. It also covers the programming process, style, and other important real-world issues. By providing exercises and problems with answers, the book helps you make sure you understand before you move on. While that book was under development, we received the proposal for C++: The Core Language. Its innovative approach is to cover only a subset of the language -- the part that's most important to learn first -- and to assume readers already know C. The idea is that C++ is just too complicated to learn all at once. So, you learn the basics solidly from this short book, which prepares you to understand some of the 200+ other C++ books and to start programming. These two books are based on different philosophies and are for different audiences. But there is one way in which they work together. If you are a C programmer, we recommend you start with C++: The Core Language, then read about advanced topics and real-world problems in Practical C++ Programming." , "name" : " Apache the Definitive Guide nd Edition.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "156592116X" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.00 cm\",\"width\":\"17.91 cm\",\"thickness\":\"1.45 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9781565921160" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "244" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Programming Languages / C++" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "4" , "subtitle" : "the core language" , "categories" : "[\"C plus plus (Computer program language)\",\"C++ (Computer program language)\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ C\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ Object Oriented\",\"Computers \\/ Software Development & Engineering \\/ General\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/ Apache the Definitive Guide nd Edition.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "1995-10-26" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "6b3a6cee-3e7f-45b5-b2ec-4dfd16bebfd2" , "small" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks2.books.google.co.in/books?id=l-8pGUDcYPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

The traditional boundaries of these two disciplines have somehow inhibited a full understanding of the functioning of and the evolution of economic and legal systems. It has often been the case that these boundaries have had to be reshaped, and sometimes abolished, before either one of the two disciplines could successfully clarify the real life problems arising from the complex institutions of contemporary societies. The contributions to this volume encompass some of the core controversial issues in law and economics arising from interactions between legal orderings and economic institutions. They include: the nature of institutional and legislative change and the emergence of strong institutional complementarity in legal positions the relationship between private orderings and the role of the State in enforcing contracts and defining property rights the nature anddynamics of endogenous enforcement and the analysis of governance models and corporate ethics.

With its own military base, a fleet of twenty aircraft, and twenty-thousand troops at the ready, Blackwater is the elite Praetorian Guard for the 'global war on terror'- yet most people have never heard of it. It was the moment the war turned; on march 31, 2004, four Americans were ambushed and burned near their jeeps by an angry mob in the Sunni stronghold of Falluja. Their charred corpses were hung from a bridge over the Euphrates River. The ensuing slaughter by U.S. troops would fuel the fierce Iraqi resistance that haunts occupation forces to this day.

This is the most influential force in your life, yet you are virtually unaware of it. Once you become aware of your personal time zone, you can begin to see and manage your life in exciting new ways. <p>In <i>The Time Paradox,</i> Drs. Zimbardo and Boyd draw on thirty years of pioneering research to reveal, for the first time, how your individual time perspective shapes your life and is shaped by the world around you. Further, they demonstrate that your and every other individual's time zones interact to create national cultures, economics, and personal destinies.<p>You will discover what time zone you live in through Drs. Zimbardo and Boyd's revolutionary tests. Ask yourself:<p><b>‚Ä¢ Does the smell of fresh-baked cookies bring you back to your childhood?<p>‚Ä¢ Do you believe that nothing will ever change in your world?<p>‚Ä¢ Do you believe that the present encompasses all and the future and past are mere abstractions?<p>‚Ä¢ Do you wear a watch, balance your checkbook, and make to-do lists -- every day? <p>‚Ä¢ Do you believe that life on earth is merely preparation for life after death?<p>‚Ä¢ Do you ruminate over failed relationships?<p>‚Ä¢ Are you the life of every party -- always late, always laughing, and always broke?</b><p>These statements are representative of the seven most common ways people relate to time, each of which, in its extreme, creates benefits and pitfalls. <i>The Time Paradox</i> is a practical plan for optimizing your blend of time perspectives so you get the utmost out of every minute in your personal and professional life as well as a fascinating commentary about the power and paradoxes of time in the modern world. <p>No matter your time perspective, you experience these paradoxes. Only by understanding this new psychological science of time zones will you be able to overcome the mental biases that keep you too attached to the past, too focused on immediate gratification, or unhealthily obsessed with future goals.

Since current methods typically rely on manually designed solution representations, agents that automatically adapt their own representations have the potential to dramatically improve performance. This book introduces two novel approaches for automatically discovering high-performing representations. The first approach synthesizes temporal difference methods, the traditional approach to reinforcement learning, with evolutionary methods, which can learn representations for a broad class ofoptimization problems. This synthesis is accomplished by customizing evolutionarymethods to the on-line nature of reinforcement learning and using them to evolve representations for value function approximators.The second approach automatically learns representations based on piecewise-constant approximations of value functions. It begins with coarse representations and gradually refines them during learning, analyzing the current policy and value function to deduce the best refinements. This book also introduces a novel method for devising input representations. This method addresses the feature selection problem by extending an algorithm that evolves the topology and weights of neural networks such that it evolves their inputs too.In addition to introducing these new methods, this book presents extensive empirical results in multiple domains demonstrating that these techniques can substantially improve performance over methodswith manual representations." , "name" : "Adaptive Representations for Reinforcement Learning Studies in Computational Intelligence .pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"22.86 cm\",\"width\":\"15.49 cm\",\"thickness\":\"0.64 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "3642139310" , "categories" : "[\"Evolutionary computation\",\"Neural networks (Computer science)\",\"Reinforcement learning\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Neural Networks\",\"Education \\/ Educational Psychology\",\"Mathematics \\/ Algebra \\/ General\",\"Technology & Engineering \\/ Engineering (General)\",\"Computers \\/ Artificial Intelligence\"]" , "contentVersion" : "0.1.0.0.preview.3" , "ISBN_13" : "9783642139314" , "publishedDate" : "2010-11-30" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "8031a3ce-b4a2-4bfd-a17a-6d6bbb150658" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Adaptive Representations for Reinforcement Learning Studies in Computational Intelligence .pdf" , "small" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=iZP_rf8WbGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks4.books.google.co.in/books?id=iZP_rf8WbGMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David MacKay's groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way. In sum, this is a textbook on information, communication, and coding for a new generation of students, and an unparalleled entry point into these subjects for professionals in areas as diverse as computational biology, financial engineering, and machine learning." , "name" : "information theory inference and learnign algorithms.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0521642981" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"26.00 cm\",\"width\":\"18.90 cm\",\"thickness\":\"3.40 cm\"}" , "ISBN_13" : "9780521642989" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "644" , "extraLarge" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=6&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Information Theory" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "13" , "categories" : "[\"Algorithms\",\"Inference\",\"Information theory\",\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition\",\"Computers \\/ Information Theory\",\"Computers \\/ Neural Networks\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Data Modeling & Design\",\"Mathematics \\/ Algebra \\/ General\",\"Philosophy \\/ Logic\"]" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/information theory inference and learnign algorithms.pdf" , "publishedDate" : "2003-10-06" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "3a9a32f1-a805-4600-ba0c-7ef3fcac6791" , "small" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=AKuMj4PN_EMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Getting the two sides to work together, however, takes some effort--largely because Java deals in objects while most databases do not. This book describes the standard Java interfaces that make portable object-oriented access to relational databases possible and offers a robust model for writing applications that are easy to maintain. It introduces the JDBC and RMI packages and uses them to develop three-tier applications (applications divided into a user interface, an object-oriented logic component, and an information store). The book begins with a quick overview of SQL for developers who may be asked to handle a database for the first time. It then explains how to issue database queries and updates through SQL and JDBC. It also covers the use of stored procedures and other measures to improve efficiency, where these are available. But the book's key contribution is a set of patterns that let developers isolate critical tasks like object creation, information storage and retrieval, and the committing or aborting of transactions. The second edition includes more basics of JDBC and SQL, with more examples, and a deeper discussion about the architecture of a robust, maintainable database application.

It begins with a detailed review of classical function estimation and proceeds with chapters on nonlinear regression, classification, and ensemble methods. The final chapters focus on clustering, dimension reduction, variable selection, and multiple comparisons. All these topics have undergone extraordinarily rapid development in recent years and this treatment offers a modern perspective emphasizing the most recent contributions. The presentation of foundational results is detailed and includes many accessible proofs not readily available outside original sources. While the orientation is conceptual and theoretical, the main points are regularly reinforced by computational comparisons.Intended primarily as a graduate level textbook for statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering students, this book assumes only a strong foundation in undergraduate statistics and mathematics, and facility with using R packages. The text has a wide variety of problems, many of an exploratory nature. There are numerous computed examples, complete with code, so that further computations can be carried out readily. The book also serves as a handbook for researchers who want a conceptual overview of the central topics in data mining and machine learning.

This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it.Programming Collective Intelligence takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains: Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset Search engine features -- crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a dataset Evolving intelligence for problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful.

We hope that this guide will help you to navigate - alongside the story's young protagonist, Lyra Belacqua - Philip Pullman's richly imagined universe, populated by armored bears, gyptians, witches, and human beings, whose d√¶mons are never far from their side. D√¶mons are one of the most striking, charming, and powerful images in The Golden Compass . These spirit-creatures, which seem like physical representations of the human soul, can change form to reflect the myriad of emotional states their humans go through as children. But in adulthood, each d√¶mon settles into the animal form that best reflects the inner nature of its human counterpart. It is in this unusual and imaginative creation that Pullman turns his sharpest mirror back onto his readers, helping us to imagine our own souls as precious, living extensions of ourselves that we can love, challenge, or even betray. The Golden Compass is a complex story that turns on a simple word: 'Dust.' This Dust does not gather in the unswept corners of Jordan College, Lyra's Oxford home. Rather, this Dust seems to reveal - or perhaps contain - the thing that makes each human being a unique creature. The concept of Dust provokes fear in some; others realize that mastery over Dust could be the source of great power. Although she does not quite realize it, Lyra - along with her d√¶mon Pantalaimon - finds her life inextricably entangled with the exploration of Dust. And as her understanding of Dust and her mastery over a mysterious tool called the alethiometer increases, the dangerous journey that she seems destined to make takes some astounding twists and turns." , "ratingsCount" : "5693" , "name" : " The Golden Compass.pdf" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"20.32 cm\",\"width\":\"13.02 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.72 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "037582345X" , "categories" : "[\"Arctic regions\",\"Belacqua, Lyra (Fictitious character)\",\"Fantasy fiction\",\"Fantasy\",\"Kidnapping\\/ Fiction\",\"Kidnapping\",\"Missing persons - Experiments\",\"Missing persons\\/ Fiction\",\"Missing persons\",\"Steampunk fiction\",\"Young adult fiction\",\"Juvenile Fiction \\/ Action & Adventure \\/ General\",\"Juvenile Fiction \\/ Fantasy & Magic\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ General\"]" , "contentVersion" : "0.1.0.0.preview.3" , "ISBN_13" : "9780375823459" , "publishedDate" : "2002-09-10" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "cfac8755-22c6-4be4-aac3-77e4cb724ddb" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/ The Golden Compass.pdf"}

A city of monsters and saints, murderers and angels, and pale girls in black velvet. Richard Mayhew is a young businessman who is about to find out more than he bargained for about this other London. A single act of kindness catapults him out of his safe and predictable life and into a world that is at once eerily familiar and yet utterly bizarre. There's a girl named Door, an Angel called Islington, an Earl who holds Court on the carriage of a Tube train, a Beast in a labyrinth, and dangers and delights beyond imagining ... And Richard, who only wants to go home, is to find a strange destiny waiting for him below the streets of his native city." , "ratingsCount" : "3604" , "name" : "Neverwhere.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "0755379950" , "categories" : "[\"Fiction \\/ General\",\"Fiction \\/ Fantasy \\/ General\",\"Fiction \\/ Horror\"]" , "contentVersion" : "0.1.0.0.preview.3" , "ISBN_13" : "9780755379958" , "publishedDate" : "2010-11-11" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "e2cb705f-02a2-4b78-9c14-cdc2b75737b1" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/BooksIndex/Neverwhere.pdf"}
