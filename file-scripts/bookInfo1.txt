The design of new datacenter networks is motivated by an array of applications ranging from communication intensive climatology, complex material simulations and molecular dynamics to such Internet applications as Web search, language translation, collaborative Internet applications, streaming video and voice-over-IP. For both Supercomputing and Cloud Computing the network enables distributed applications to communicate and interoperate in an orchestrated and efficient way.This book describes the design and engineering tradeoffs of datacenter networks. It describes interconnection networks from topology and network architecture to routing algorithms, and presents opportunities for taking advantage of the emerging technology trends that are influencing router microarchitecture. With the emergence of \"many-core\" processor chips, it is evident that we will also need \"many-port\" routing chips to provide a bandwidth-rich network to avoid the performance limiting effects of Amdahl's Law. We provide an overview of conventional topologies and their routing algorithms and show how technology, signaling rates and cost-effective optics are motivating new network topologies that scale up to millions of hosts. The book also provides detailed case studies of two high performance parallel computer systems and their networks.Table of Contents: Introduction / Background / Topology Basics / High-Radix Topologies / Routing / Scalable Switch Microarchitecture / System Packaging / Case Studies / Closing Remarks" , "name" : "high Performance datacenter networks.pdf" , "subtitle" : "Architectures, Algorithms, and Opportunities" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"23.50 cm\",\"width\":\"19.05 cm\",\"thickness\":\"0.64 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1608454029" , "categories" : "[\"Computer network architectures\",\"Computer networks\",\"Parallel computers\",\"Computers \\/ Systems Architecture \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Data Processing\",\"Computers \\/ Networking \\/ General\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781608454020" , "publishedDate" : "2010-11-30" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "c86ad1de-24de-40db-8ee5-921123a34a09" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/Books/high Performance datacenter networks.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks6.books.google.co.in/books?id=1_TUzIaKkdsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Using scores of photographs of faces that reflect the emotions of surprise, fear, disgust, anger, happiness, and sadness, the authors of Unmasking the Face explain how to identify correctly these basic emotions and how to tell when people try to mask, simulate, or neutralize them. And, to help you better understand our own emotions and those of others, this book describes not only what these emotions look like when expressed on the face, but also what they feel like when you experience them. In addition, Unmasking the Face features several practical exercises that will help actors, teachers, salesmen, counselors, nurses, and physicians -- and everyone else who deals with people -- to become adept, perceptive readers of the facial expressions of emotion.

Insights into Game Theory addresses this problem by providing students with an understanding of the key concepts and ideas of game theory without using formal mathematical notation. The authors use four very different topics (college admission, social justice and majority voting, coalitions and co-operative games, and a bankruptcy problem from the Talmud) to investigate four areas of game theory.

Combining elements of Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, the newly introduced hybrid random fields are an interesting approach to get the best of both these worlds, with an added promise of modularity and scalability. The authors have written an enjoyable book---rigorous in the treatment of the mathematical background, but also enlivened by interesting and original historical and philosophical perspectives.-- Manfred Jaeger, Aalborg UniversitetThe book not only marks an effective direction of investigation with significant experimental advances, but it is also---and perhaps primarily---a guide for the reader through an original trip in the space of probabilistic modeling. While digesting the book, one is enriched with a very open view of the field, with full of stimulating connections. [...] Everyone specifically interested in Bayesian networks and Markov random fields should not miss it.-- Marco Gori, Universit degli Studi di SienaGraphical models are sometimes regarded---incorrectly---as an impractical approach to machine learning, assuming that they only work well for low-dimensional applications and discrete-valued domains. While guiding the reader through the major achievements of this research area in a technically detailed yet accessible way, the book is concerned with the presentation and thorough (mathematical and experimental) investigation of a novel paradigm for probabilistic graphical modeling, the hybrid random field. This model subsumes and extends both Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. Moreover, it comes with well-defined learning algorithms, both for discrete and continuous-valued domains, which fit the needs of real-world applications involving large-scale, high-dimensional data." , "name" : "Hybrid Random Fields A Scalable Approach to Structure and Parameter Learning in Probabilistic Graphical Models.pdf" , "ISBN_10" : "3642203078" , "ISBN_13" : "9783642203077" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "pageCount" : "217" , "mainCategory" : "Computers / Computer Science" , "printType" : "BOOK" , "medium" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.in/books?id=1kW-miAIgxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=3&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "thumbnail" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.in/books?id=1kW-miAIgxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "smallThumbnail" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.in/books?id=1kW-miAIgxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "ratingsCount" : "1" , "subtitle" : "A Scalable Approach to Structure and Parameter Learning in Probabilistic Graphical Models" , "categories" : "[\"Computers \\/ Intelligence (AI) & Semantics\",\"Technology & Engineering \\/ Engineering (General)\",\"Computers \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Artificial Intelligence\",\"Computers \\/ Computer Science\"]" , "publishedDate" : "2011-04-29" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "725085b8-d276-4d9f-b948-4cd7e4ce9bc3" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/Books/Hybrid Random Fields A Scalable Approach to Structure and Parameter Learning in Probabilistic Graphical Models.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.in/books?id=1kW-miAIgxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api" , "large" : "http://bks5.books.google.co.in/books?id=1kW-miAIgxMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=4&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

As it can deliver those services, efficiently and with quality, at compelling price levels, cloud computing is with us to stay. Ubiquitously and quite definitively, cloud computing is answering the demand for sophisticated, flexible services Cloud Computing: Technologies and Strategies of the Ubiquitous Data Centerlooks at cloud computing from an IT manager \"s perspective. It answers basic as well as strategic questions from both a business and a technical perspective so that you can confidently engage both IT and financial assets in making your organization techno- savvy, efficient, and competitive. Any answers about the future of computing are definitely in the clouds The first section of the book offers up a history of the computing roots that have evolved into cloud computing. It looks at how IT has been traditionally serving needs and how cloud computing improves and expands on these services, so you can strategize about how a cloud might provide solutions to specific IT questions or answer business needs. Next, the book shows how to begin the process of determining which organizational needs would best be served and improved by cloud computing. Presenting specific cases as examples, the book walks you through issues that your organization might likely encounter. Written clearly and succinctly, it -- Introduces you to the concepts behind different types of clouds, including those used for storage, those that improve processor and application delivery, and those that mix any and all of these services Covers typical concerns you will hear with regard to such issues as security, application integration, and structural limitations Looks at the future of clouds, from developments right on the horizon to those still in the planning stage By the book \"s conclusion, you will have a solid basis on which to initiate strategic discussions about deploying clouds in your organization. You will understand how cloud computing can affordably solve real problems. You will know which strategies to use and you will learn of the pitfalls to avoid when taking your data center to the clouds. Throughout this book are the answers you need to the many questions from the most basic to the more advanced surrounding cloud computing and its place in your enterprise. What exactly is cloud computing? How are clouds different than virtualization? Should my organization use a cloud (or multiple clouds)? Can clouds and virtualization play significant roles in my organization at the same time? Covering the basics of virtualization and clusters and the more advanced strategic considerations of security and return on investment, this book will be your guide to IT \"s present and future in the cloud, a resource that you will continually turn to.

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.<br><br><i>Probabilistic Graphical Models</i> discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty.<br><br>The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter.

His research career started in the mid-1960s in Poland, in the Institute of Automation, Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland. He left for the USA in 1970, and since then had worked there at various universities, notably, at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and finally, until his untimely death, at George Mason University. We, the editors, had been lucky to be able to meet and collaborate with Ryszard for years, indeed some of us knew him when he was still in Poland. After he started working in the USA, he was a frequent visitor to Poland, taking part at many conferences until his death.

CBD does away with the language and vendor-specific limitations of OOP, makes software reuse more practical and accelerates the development process. Event-based programming is the next logical step in CBD, and makes components more reusable due to their decoupled nature. But event-based systems are easier to develop, which means they're cheaper and more reliable than traditional OOP or CBD systems. This book teaches you how to develop software based on parts that interact primarily through an event mechanism. You'll learn how to use events in many different situations, to solve recurring development problems without coupling. The book introduces Signal Wiring Diagram, a novel form of software diagram similar to the circuit diagrams used by hardware designers. The book concludes with a series of case studies, incorporating all featured concepts. In a nutshell, you'll want to pick up a copy of this book because it How to use an event-based paradigm to reduce or completely eliminate coupling between classes and components Describes components, including coordinators, workers, builders, binders, and routers Three complete case studies that model concepts being used to design small, medium, and large systems" , "name" : "event based programming taking events to limit.pdf" , "subtitle" : "taking events to the limit" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"25.00 cm\",\"width\":\"17.78 cm\",\"thickness\":\"4.06 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "1590596439" , "categories" : "[\"Computer Science\",\"Electronic data processing\",\"Object-oriented programming (Computer science)\",\"Parallel programming (Computer science)\",\"Programming Techniques\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Software Development & Engineering \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ Object Oriented\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9781590596432" , "publishedDate" : "2006" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "af7577bb-0030-454d-9510-418671ee861e" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/Books/event based programming taking events to limit.pdf" , "small" : "http://bks8.books.google.co.in/books?id=9CL446IzhuAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}

Special constraints apply to this domain, which are not always taken into consideration by academic research, but are critical for successful security applications: large volumes: techniques must be able to handle huge amounts of data and perform 'on-line' computation; scalability: algorithms must have processing times that scale well with ever growing volumes; automation: the analysis process must be automated so that information extraction can 'run on its own'; ease of use: everyday citizens should be able to extract and assess the necessary information; and robustness: systems must be able to cope with data of poor quality (missing or erroneous data). The NATO Advanced Study Institute (ASI) on Mining Massive Data Sets for Security, held in Italy, September 2007, brought together around ninety participants to discuss these issues. This publication includes the most important contributions, but can of course not entirely reflect the lively interactions which allowed the participants to exchange their views and share their experience. The bridge between academic methods and industrial constraints is systematically discussed throughout.

The structure package, a collection of nearly 100 different classes implementing a wide variety of data structures, has been the basis of Java Structures for more than five years. Thousands of faculty, students, researchers, industrial and recreational programmers have investigated this lean and well tested approach to data structure design. In this edition, the text develops a heavily tested package that is independent of but consistent with the Collection package offered by Sun. In many cases, the variety of implementations provides the programmer choices of data structure that are not available with the Collection system. For those curricula that make use of the Collection package, the structure package can be easily integrated into existing applications. All classes are fully documented and make consistent use of pre- and post-conditioning, and include support for assertion testing. The second edition also brings a wealth of new resources, including a large number of new and original exercises and drill problems. Throughout the text, exercises appear in the running text to direct a deeper consideration of subtle issues by students. Perhaps the most innovative feature (first found in Bailey's Java Elements) is the inclusion of more than a dozen original lab exercises that focus on interesting and often classic problems of computer science.All code for the book's examples, documentation, and the STRUCTURE package is posted on the book's website at www.mhhe.com/javastructures." , "name" : " Java Structures Data Structures in Java for the Principled Programmer 2nd edition .pdf" , "subtitle" : "data structures in Java for the principled programmer" , "dimensions" : "{\"height\":\"25.00 cm\",\"width\":\"19.30 cm\",\"thickness\":\"2.44 cm\"}" , "ISBN_10" : "0072399090" , "categories" : "[\"Data structures (Computer science)\",\"Java (Computer program language)\",\"Computers \\/ Database Management \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming \\/ General\",\"Computers \\/ Programming Languages \\/ Java\"]" , "contentVersion" : "preview-1.0.0" , "ISBN_13" : "9780072399097" , "publishedDate" : "2003" , "language" : "en" , "uuid" : "e25b2561-c9c1-481e-9b81-1d539fc26360" , "localFileName" : "/home/neeraj/Desktop/Echo/Books/ Java Structures Data Structures in Java for the Principled Programmer 2nd edition .pdf"}
